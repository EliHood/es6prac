let owl =  122 % 3;

console.log(owl);


/*

10 % 5=0
9 % 5=4 (because the remainder of 9 when divided by 5 is 4)
8 % 5=3
7 % 5=2
6 % 5=1

5 % 5=0 (because it is fully divisible by 5)


EX 1
-------

7 % 5 

how many times can 5 go to 7

5 * 0 = 0 <- not close enough

5 * 1 = 5 <- the closest multiple that can go into 7

so 7 - 5 = 2

2 is the remainder




EX 2
--------

9 % 5 

5 * 0 =  0 not close enough

5 * 1 = 5 <- being that this the closest number that can go into 9

9-5 = 4  is the remainder


EX 3
-------

13 % 2 

2 * 6 = 12 is the closest multiple that can go into 13

so 13-12 = 1 is the remainder


EX 4
-------

122 % 3  (find the closest multiple that can go into 122)

3 * 40 = 120

122-120 = 2
